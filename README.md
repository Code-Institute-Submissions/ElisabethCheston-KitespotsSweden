# MS2 - Kitespots Sweden
A map to locate all the current kitesurfing spots in Sweden.

### Background 
The core focus for this MS2 project was to create functional Javascript features for user to interact with. Since JavaScript was totally new to me, I wanted to keep it simple and focus on understanding the coding process. I first had a map idea to display all Swedish kitespots with features for each of them and implement weather or route direction functions. But with weather and route directions it became complicated, so had a game idea that I tried, then got stuck. So, went back to do a simpler version of the first idea, kitespots in Sweden. 

## UX
This webpage is for all kitesurfers (and windsurfer/surfer) who want to know all the current  functional spots in Sweden where you can surf. Important to provide maps so user can see the conditions of lounging area, sea depth, which way the spot faces and what the optimal wind direction would be. The idea is to provide a dropdown list with all the spots that easy zooms in to the selected kitespot. 

### Research
Since there is no updated list of all current functional kitespots, I’ve researched old once as well as new once from word of mouth. Then I created a new geojson file for all usable kitespots in geojson.io. Spots that has been excluded are for reasons like private property, unfunctional launching area, rocky watersurface, etc.

### User Stories
*	As a user, I would like to get easy access to all the spots
*	As a user, I want the spots to be usable, so I won’t waist a lot of time going there.
*	As a user, I would like to get information of the kitespots wind direction, to determine its usability for current weather.
*	As a user, I want to easily access all the spots for a current wind direction, to know which kitespots are usable at the moment.
*	As a user, I would like to be able to search for specific spots by name, to easily find it.
*	As a user, I would like to see a bar that shows distance, to determined how far it would be to get there.
*	As a user, I would like to be able to zoom in on the spot to see the surrounding, to determine if launching area works for me.
*	As a user, I would like to see the kitespots on different maps, to plan trip.
*	As a user, I would like to know the nearest city, if am not from the area and need to look up commondations.

### Features
Feature functions in the project:

#### Existing Features

* **Zooms** - In the top left corner user can zoom in and out of the map window to better research the area.

* **Search Control** – A dropdown list (in the top right corner) that presents all kitespots. Since it can be hard to know the spelling of some places and user could have heard it by word of mouth, a dropdown list is easer to search for the name instead of a control user have to write in the names.

* **Zoom in to selected spots** - Upon selected spot the maps zooms in to the position and the marker popsup with information.
 
* **Cluster spots** - When user first load the page the first thing they can see on the map is cluster spots of all the kitespots. It groups the spots together in groups depending on the projection to make the map less 'messy' or cluttery'. When clicked on the or zoomed in to the cluser divides up to smaller groups until the accual markers shows.

* **Control Layer Toggler** – That contains all the baselayer and overlayers. Upon hovering the icon opens and layers can be selected.

* **Baselayers** - Gives the users the option to choose different maps to view the kitespots in. Only one map can be displayed at a time.

* **Overlayer** - Gives the user the option to see cities and regions on map. Here both layers can be selected simultaneously.

* **Kitespot popups with image and link** - Popup opens automatic upon selected.

* **City popups with image and link** - Shows the users the the position of swedish cities. The markers do not have cluster on map. Popup include text, picute and link to google.

* **Region popups** - Shows the users the the position of swedish regions as popygons. In the middle of the regions is a popup with region name.

* **Geolocator** - Shows users popsition on map if user have given promission to it in browser.

* **Scale** - In the bottom left corner user can see the scale that changes value depending on the zoom level.

* **Image popup fit screen** - In order fro the popup not to get cut upon open.

* **Attribution** - In the bottom right corner user can see the attribution from map providers and other integraded systems used.


#### Features Left to Implement
* **Weather prognose** – I would like to implement current and future weather info for each kitespot. Also marker that changes color once its location works with the wind direction and the parameters showing good enough wind speed for kitesurfing, as well as information on weather conditions, water temperature, air temperature. To get accurate information you need to use backend programs as well as payed services.

* **Kitespot information** – Like to implement information on the different spots like launching size, beach condition (gras, sand, rocks..), water dept, as well as parking, GPS connection (a lot of areas don’t have a good reception). To get accurate information you need to use backend programs as well as payed services.

* **Travel direction** – Implement traveling directions from current location to spot destination. For this you need to use a payed service in ESRI.

#### Bugs or problems

* **Error message for (index):1** - In console error message "Unchecked runtime.lastError: The message port closed before a response was received.". In conversations with tutors, they said it's some type of bug for the <!DOCTYPE html> that can't be solved.

* **Error message** ( "=> only available in ES6 (use 'esversion: 6')" ) in JSHint when => is used in Leaflet. Solved with "// jshint esversion:6" in the JavaScript files for JSHint to ignore the error.

* **Letter "L"** for Leaflet, throught a warning of "undefined" in JSHint.

* **Json files** - In JSHint sees geojson files as undefined.
